# Predicting_wine_quality

This project is part of the Kaggle's competition, and for this project, kaggle's Red Wine Quality (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009) dataset was used to bulid various classification models to predict whether a particular red wine is "good quality" or not. A quality score between 0 and 10 was given to each wine in this dataset. The output was converted to a binary output where each wine is either "good quality" (a score of 7 or higher) or not (a score below 7). The output i.e the quality of the wine was determined by 11 input variables in total.

For the modeling part, AutoGluon Framework and some decision tree models were used. AutoGluon trains multiple models and ensembles them together to ensure superior predictive performance.
